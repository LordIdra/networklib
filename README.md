# NetworkLib
A demonstration library for training basic neural networks, including dataset handling and importing from .txt files. As of writing this, the library can run a basic fully-connected deep neural network simulation with the ability to procedurally add layers and set custom network structure. Importantly, this is more of a showcase than anything.
